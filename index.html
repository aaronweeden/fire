    <h2>Model Description</h2>
    <p>
      Trees are arranged in a 2D grid with a boundary of burnt
      trees along the outside. A random tree is initially caught on fire.
      Thereafter, at each time step, each non-burning tree checks
      each of its neighbors to the north, east, south, and west to
      see if any are burning. If any are burning, the tree who is
      checking will be burning with some random chance in the next
      time step.
    </p>
